1. virtual memory
    Virtual memory not only keeps processes safe (because one process cannot directly read or modify another process's memory) 
    it also allows the system to efficiently allocate and re-allocate portions of memory to different processes.
    Virtual maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory.
    Swap infrequenty data into mememory on disk.
   TLB = Translation Lookaside Buffer. used to map virtual address to physical address quickly
   
   Resident Set is the portion of memory occupied by a process that is held in main memory (RAM). The rest of the occupied memory exists in the swap space or file system, either because some parts of the occupied memory were paged out, or because some parts of the executable were never loaded
   Thrashing
   when the required page is not in resident set, OS has to access virtual memory or disk. The computer spends an unsuitably large amount of time transferring pages to and from a backing store, hence slowing down useful work.

2. write-through v.s. write-back cache
   write-through: write cache and memory both;
   write-back: initially, writing is done only to the cache. The write to the backing store is postponed until the cache blocks containing the data are about to be modified/replaced by new content.
   
3. process v.s. thread
    (1) Definition:  a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. A process contains one or more threads.
                     a thread is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler
    (2) Difference: Process runs in separate memory spaces, and threads run in shared memory spaces;
                    Process has independent address space and is independent on other processes
                    Thread switch is light-weight compared with process switch
                    Processes provide better isolation between actions
    
4. Hadoop / MapReduce / Pig 

5. RAID
    Redundant Array of Inexpensive (or Independent) Disks is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.
    There were five RAID levels: RAID1, RAID2, RAID3, RAID4, RAID5
    
    
6. Implement HashMap, put，get and remove  (multithreads access using lock slicing ＋ CAS)

7.  IPC，ITC   IPC = Inter-Process Communication,  ITC = Inter-Thread Communication
    A process cannot access memory inside another process. Processes can communicate by:
    (1) Network packeges
    (2) Files
    (3) Pipes
    (4) Shared memory
    (5) Semaphores
    (6) Corba messages (Java)
    (7) RPC calls
    
    Threads can communicate by accessing the memory in the same processes. For programmers, use wait(), notify() and notifyAll() for communication.

8.  Exception
    Why use exception in Java (benefits)?
      (1) Separating Error-Handling Code from "Regular" Code
      (2) Propagating Errors Up the Call Stack
      (3) Grouping and Differentiating Error Types
      
9. DeadLock: (1) mutual exclusion, (2) hold and wait, (3) no preemption, (4) Circular wait
          avoid deadlock:  make sure access critical section in the same order; introduce preemption

10. At-least once  v.s. Exactly once

11. SQL v.s. NoSql
    SQL databases represent data in form of tables; NoSql databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema
    NoSql may not require fixed table schemas, usually avoid join operations, and typically scale horizontally. Academic researchers typically refer to these databases as structured storage,
    SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
    SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. 
    
12. Java Synchronization
